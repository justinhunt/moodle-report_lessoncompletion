Lesson Completion Report
=======================

This is a course report which will display the list of visible lesson activities in the current course, and if/when the selected user has completed them.

It would be a trivial task to alter this to display scorm or some other activity module completion.

While not currently implemented the code has been structured so that the addition of export to pdf or export to excel can be implemented with minimal changes to existing code.
